# CodeNote flasks micro services

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing


USER1 :
gets wind of an awesome surfing website where he can buy surfboards,
he finds the link thru soacial media & connects , he browses the site for a few minutes & decides he might make a purchase , he completes his purchase with out having to create an account
Test1 User1 ( True/False )
Was User1 able to complete his purchase with out having to create an account?
True


USER2:
is just packing up from surfing for the day, when she hears an advert on the radio about an online surf shop , she clicks on ,after being in the water all day she fills in her details incorrectly, she tries again with all the correct details , but being in such a hurry , she never finishes the task , so she puts the phone down , when she arrives home , she brings her mobile with her , she puts it down , her daugther picks it up & begins exploring the website, she gets thru most of it & discovers the cart , she manages to get all the way with a pink surfboard she quite fancied, she gets to the stripe popup box, & recalls her dad working treiesly on something the exact same on his computer, she remembers what to do , she manages to remeber the test long password with the same numbers , then she remembers the easy one with 3 numbers , 

She is then left with the calender, she does not qiute understand this type of calender, so she fills in what she knows and carrys on , she see,s the little box shake with disagreement & decides she better put it away

Test1 User2 ( True/False )
Was User2 able to create an account when she filled in her details incorrectly?
Falsh
Was User2 daugther able to make a purchase when she filled in her details incorrectly?
falsh
RESULT 100%



USER3
is coming home from work on the bus  he begins to shoulder surf another passengers laptop , as he admires the website he retrives his mobile from his pocket & reads the address, connects to the website, he attempts signing up for the first time , USER3 has only been using a mobile for a week he has spent most of his life on the beach, must be why his eyes are so good,
he fills in his details with the first name & the last name as the same name,
he then attempts to only enter in 6 characters in the passsword field, with an incorrect email address , 

After a bit of a shock from all the errors he concetrates on the insructions before him , after a few minutes studying , he fills out all the info correctly, except for his email address, he then attempts for the second time to register an account , observing the error , he realises he has forgotten his @ symbol , he then corrects his typo & proceeds , 

Test1 User3 ( True/False )
Was User3 able to create an account when he filled in his details incorrectly?

# This Full Stack Framework eCommecre application looks & responses very very well across all screen sizes 

# There is one problem with my application & it is a subscription I have been locked out of my mail gun because I mistakenly pushed an api key , after removing the api key from GitHub I proceeded to contact mailgun,There I followwed the support team I correcting all the details of my account , where I set up 2step verification using the Google Auth App  but now I am totally locked out of my account.
I tried to signup for another account but they only except 1 mobile number & 1 credit card number My Project is ready & setup for email intergration as soon as mailgun unlocks my account, I am presently in contact with Mailgun, 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

- The stages to deploy this project were very ordered & structured,
- first I needed to make sure I had an up to date version of HerokuCLI
- Once established I proceeded to login to my heroku account in my cloud9 bash terminal
- With my project all ready under source control I reinitilised my git repo with git init 
- My Next task was to create an app with a unique name from the HerokuCLI with the command heroku apps:create 
- With my new app created I recieved my new heroku git address/url 
- I clarafied my new remote address with the command git remote -v 
- To clarafay my app creation I checked my heroku cloud managment console once satisfied I proceeded 
- Herokus ephemeral file system dictates that the file storage is not permanant, because of this I used the technuigue of provisioning a postgres database on my heroku platform
- I achieved this with the HerokuCLI by running the command heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev , this gives me the free thier , the excate same as creating from the heroku cloud managment console
- this task attached a database url connection & set the env varaiable to DATABASE_URL , this url acts as a pointer when I deploy my application to my new postgres database

## Deployment Stage2

- Next task in deployment was to update my requirements.txt with the package psyscop2 & gunicorn, heroku needs these packages to
- psyscop2 is the postgres database driver sql depands on this driver when you connect to a postgres database with heroku as the hosting platform
- I also added gunicorn , this package is required to connect to heroku server,
- next I needed to freeze my requirements to make sure all my packages are updated 
- Procfile was next up , I created this file in  the top level of my project the folder on cloud9 & then added the relevent values to tell heroku
- Then I created a Procfile , to establish with heroku what type of app is being served ,
- in my Procfile I made the necessary configerations of web: flask db upgrade; flask translate compile; gunicorn blog:app
- I then used the herokCLI to set my env variable with the command heroku config:set FLASK_APP=blog.py
- With this command this env variable, will exist in heroku in side the application env


## Deployment Stage3

- Next I needed to
- Git add ./Git commit -m ""/ Git push/ to my local repo on my machine
- this will also sync my repo on GitGub, now both my branchs are now at the master branch
- Finally I ran the command Git push heroku master to sync my Heroku repo
-
